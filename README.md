### Versions ###

Several flavors of this data are, or will be, available.  The current release is for U.S. States only, without the addition of commonweaths or U.S. territories.  Future releases will be available that includes these areas.  

More granular county and city level versions planned for future releases.

### Notice ###

This is very much a rough-draft repository.  It's recommended that if using any of the data files in this, to not link directly to the raw files as they will most likely have locations in the directory structure moved as more data is added to this set.


### Usage Restrictions ###

Absolutely none.  Please feel free to use these in any way, including redistribution and resale (if that's even possible).  No credit or linking required.  This work is in the public domain and for any and all to use.  Enjoy.
